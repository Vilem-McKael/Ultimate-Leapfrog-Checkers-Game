 Project Proposal:

 I will be building a functional checkers game, called "Ultimate Hopscotch" - like hopscotch, but if you get hopped over, you're out. I have thus chosen a green & earth-tone color scheme in order to figuratively represent two teams in a field playing hopscotch.
 
 My minimum viable product, or the baseline where I will consider the project to be successful, is an in-browser checkers game that allows a player to move, capture pieces (once per turn), and allows a player to win or lose. Instead of building a two-player checkers game for this base version of the game, I have chosen to start with a basic computer AI that will randomly choose a move from its set of possible moves, or capture if possible.

 If I finish the minimum viable product early, I would like to explore adding some of the following features. First, I'd like to add "king" functionality, where once a piece reaches the other end of the game board it has the option to move AND capture both backwards and forwards. Second, I would like to add the ability for a piece to capture multiple pieces in one turn if possible, in line with the classic rules of checkers. Third, I'd be interested in adding the option to play against the computer OR another player. This would be determined by adding a button below the "rules" section of my HTML document that allows the player to choose an option while setting up the game. Fourth, I'd like to lookin into adding some sort of display element that shows how many pieces each player has captured. And lastly, if I am able to incorporate all of the above mechanics into my game, I would love to change out the game pieces with handmade pixel art of people crouched over, as if they're playing hopsctoch.

MVP:
- Displays checkerboard
- Player can choose which piece color they want to play as, and the game will begin accordingly. (dark always plays first)
- Pieces can move and capture other pieces, removing them from the board.
- If a piece can capture, the piece must capture.
-    However, the "double-capture" mechanic of checkers will not be a requirement for the game to be considered to have met the MVP
- The computer opponent will randomly move, and capture when necessary.

Stretch goals:
- If a piece can capture multiple pieces in one turn, it can & must.
- If a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board, it becomes a "king" piece and can move and capture both forwards and backwards diagonally.
- The user can choose to play the computer OR play another player. Player vs player would be done using the same mouse, in the same browser.
- Add an HTML element that displays how many pieces each player has captured, either as a number or as the pieces themselves, or both.
- Update the art of the game with homemade pixel art (probably too far of a stretch goal)
